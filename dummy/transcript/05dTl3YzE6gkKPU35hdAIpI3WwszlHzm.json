"Being on tour doesn't differ that much from being on Broadway which has a week. They're both a grind and they're both hard work. It's all live performance. It's all putting yourself out there on a stage in front of a bunch of people that you're making yourself vulnerable in front of them. For me, it's not that different. It's got the same fear and the same thrills and the same exhilarating adrenaline rush and it's just a matter of maybe placing just a little different."
