"Hi, I'm Mary Elizabeth Winstead and this is my attempts at telling a joke. So, a man is sitting at a bar having a drink and a lady walks in and says `What are you drinking?`. The man says `magic beer`. The Lady says `Magic beer? What's so special about it?`. The guy says `what's so special about it?`. He gets up, flies around the roof 3 times, and he sets back down. She snaps at him and she says, `I bet you can do that again if you're left it on it.`. So, he gets up, flies around the roof 3 more times. So ladies says `I'll have what he's having!` She chugs down the beer, goes up to the roof, jumps, falls to death. The bartender looks at the guy sitting at the bar and he says, `Superman, you are such a jerk when you're drunk.`."
